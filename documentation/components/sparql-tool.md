# SPARQL Tool

The SPARQL Tool allows the user to edit a SPARQL query and to send that query to a configurable endpoint and visualize the returned results. 

### Presets 

The SPARQL Tool comes with some presets which can be accessed by expanding the "Presets" dropdown at the top of the component. The presets are grouped for convenience. Simply click on a desired preset to load the appropriate configuration \(endpoint, query, and under the hood query parameters\), and then click "RUN" to get results. 

#### MeSH 

The MeSH presets connect to the public MeSH SPARQL endpoint 

#### Wikidata
