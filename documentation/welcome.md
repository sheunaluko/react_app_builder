# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for MedKit! 

I hope that MedKit is sufficiently documented so that you are excited to use it and contribute to its development. I am updating the documentation for MedKit as I build it, so right now things may be subject to change.  

The main documentation that exists right now is that for several MedKit [components](https://alukosheun.gitbook.io/medkit/documentation/components). Check it out to see what the provided components can do right out of the box. Some examples include: 

1. Search, filter, and select MeSH Descriptors for entry into a Problem List.  
2. Edit a SPARQL query, choose an endpoint, and display query results. 

### Roadmap 

#### Current Status 

Currently, the MedKit application is in early developmental stages and the documentation is being simultaneously written. It is a project of Sheun Aluko who is a MD/MS student at Stanford Medical School. 

Several components have already been developed, however their functionality may not be complete. This documentation both serves as a reference for what has been implemented as well as what _will_ be implemented in the future. I do my best to indicate which features have already been implemented vs those that have not when it seems appropriate. However, you can always [demo](https://alukosheun.gitbook.io/medkit/getting-started/running-medkit) the running app to see what using MedKit is currently like. 

#### Goals 

I currently envision MedKit as being an open source software toolkit for performing clinical decision support and medical education. In order to achieve this, it must be simple to create, distribute, and utilize MedKit components. This is not currently possible, but I am keeping this in mind as I develop MedKit and plan to implement this feature in the future.
