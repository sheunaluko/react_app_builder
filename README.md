## Motivation

React app builder is a modified typescript create-react-app project directory. Instead of waiting for create-react-app to create a project directory every time I wanted to prototype or build a new website, I reorganized the folders to allow for compilation of multiple websites from the same directory. Note: the directory structure may be of interest, but cloning this entire repository is not likely to be helpful for you as it contains my own personal prototypes/applications in the src/apps/ directory. 

Current projects within this repository include: 

##### DreamCatcher (src/apps/dream_catcher/App.tsx): 
A modern digital dream journal for recording your dreams using speech recognition and reviewing them later. 

##### More to come!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
