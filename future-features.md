# Future Features

This section serves to outline potential future MedKit features. They are listed under subsections. 

### Study Guides 

To further serve as a tool for medical education, MedKit could have a "Study Guides" interface which connects to community curated study guides for various topics. For example, under the main section "Microbiology" there could be an "Antibiotics" study guide. The study guide itself can be created by any MedKit user and uploaded to a database of study guides hosted in the cloud. When the user attempts to create the study guide a unique name must be chosen. The study guide itself will consist of a custom  MedKit Component which renders a particular interface. For example, the "Antibiotic" study guide might allow the user to navigate the MeSH antibiotic sub tree and upon selection of any antibiotic view various properties of that antibiotic from Wikidata. 

### Shared Community Database of Components, Views, etc 

MedKit will truly become a collaborative and sustainable project when users can Edit and Share MedKit Components. 

A MedKit Component is essentially a React component written in Typescript \(a .tsx file\). Thus, it appears the MedKit must be able to connect to a repository of such community created components. 

I am still deciding on the best way to achieve this, and any thoughts are very welcome \(please send to alukosheun@gmail.com\).
