# Running MedKit

## Running from the public url 

The most recent version of the MedKit web application \(website\) will be accessible [here](https://github.com/sheunaluko/react_app_builder/tree/master/src/apps/medkit). However, right now MedKit is in a pre-release form and thus this link points to the github repository. When I release MedKit, the link above will point to a live demo of the application. 

## Running locally 

If you would like to run MedKit locally, and contribute to its development, please refer to the [github repository](https://github.com/sheunaluko/react_app_builder/tree/master/src/apps/medkit) \(step by step instructions are not yet available\).
