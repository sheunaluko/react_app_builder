  TODO ADD CARDS WITH TRANITIONS AND PAGINATION TO CREATE 
   A SERIES OF INTRO NOTES  
   
   Can have a MANUAL TAB which displays a permanent drawer on the left and 
   IS like a resource for lucid dreaming with youtube links, etc 
   
   Have a way for people to send feedback for the APP, which sends the message to firebase 
   where I can see it (an an optional email if they like) 



//cool components = pagination/ card/ speed dial 

//use the "toggle button" in the Lab components for showing AUDIO/Manual Entry 

//HAVE A VOICE CONTROL TUTORIAL ! 



TOCHECK 
: when editing then saving a dream - is the data and time preserved?
