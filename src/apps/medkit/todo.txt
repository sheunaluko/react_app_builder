[ ] WORKING on research project now  , need to finalize interface 

  - Allow visualizing selected items by tab (based on property they matched) 
  - Show the results in TWO views 
  
    - 1) group by property match , then disease , then symptom 
      - this way can watch it build it as you add symptoms 
      	     - when a symptom is added we immediately retrieve ALL relevant properties for it and this gets cached 
	     - as new symptoms are added the info is added and cache utilized 
	     
    - 2) can summarize results (either as they happen or on separate tab - though as they happen likely better!) 
      	    - can divide the Results tab into upper 1/3 and lower 2/3 . the upper one shows 5 rows and like 4 or 5 columns of the current disease rankings 1-5 in rows 1-5, then 6-11, etc 
	    - the bottom 2/3 consists of TABS? where the tab label gives info on how many current matches exist ... when you click on a tab you see the specific dta 
	    - next to Results is a PROGRESS wheel that goes on when the underlying sparql query is running 
	    

[ ] 
DONT FORGET ABOUT lab vallues 




    
[ ] Create ability to show GitBook Docs directly in the app. 
     - send hyperloop http_get for the docs page (filter out the center content) 

    
[ ] Have a concept called Views 
  - There are Views over single problems [problems here is synonymous with MeSH descriptors] (for example a view which takes a problem and shows all 'drugs used for treatment' if any exist) 
    - or one that renders the 'anatomical location' 
    - these single views can be displayed in a grid to show case the attributes of a particular problem in (or outside) the problem list 
    - the views should support being able to pass information to them, and they will only request it from the apis if it is missing 
    

  - There are Views over a SET of descriptors/problems, which may perform more complex data retrieval/ calculations in order to render insightful information 
    - for example a View dedicated to showing if there are any OVERLAPPING medications which treat the condition 
    - renders a bar graph of the risk factors 
    - the views should support being able to pass information to them, and they will only request it from the apis if it is missing 



[x] create MeSH Entity Selector  

[x] create problem list widget , which uses TABS to toggle between MESH Entity Selector and the DISPLAY 
  - working on this currently  
  - Finish problem list search tools, add another top level accordion 
  - ACtually implement search which filters based on tree numbers 
  - Add a limit selector to the serach tools 
  - create profiles for the tree selection so I can quickly embed a MeSH searcher which 
    - defaults to particular inclusions/ etc 
    


[x] Add little info icon next to componenets that links to the gitbook documentation 

[ ] Create a MetaWidget that allows addition/deletion/changeTo of any other MedKit widget  

[x Update sattsys node to keep a log of all activity and RESTART the websocket server if it crashes ... 99% uptime will be very important 
  - when working on a team 

[ ] create Wikidata Symptom Selector 
  - would probably be better to allow for modular searching of all the properties below  (i.e. findings, treatments etc) 

[ ] create symptom list widget , which uses TABS to toggle between Wikidata Symptom Selector and the DISPLAY 

[ ] some kind of metrics / analytics for looking at WIkidata properties/ entities/ etc..  

Interesting properties: 
- possible medical findings 
- risk factor 
- symptoms 
- possible treatment 
- drug used for treatment 
- prevalence  
- incidence
- medical condition treated 
- has cause
- medical examinations 
- significant drug ineraction 


Think about the data that has to be input for a patient 

HPI (symptoms) 
PMH (problem list) 
PSH (problem list) 
SH  (? risk factors)
VITALS (observations) 
LAB VALUES (loinc?) 
PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS (?possible medical findings) 
Imaging findings ? 
Microbiology findings
