Next: 
[ ] Create voice/text interface for wikidata of step up 2 medicine info --> this will be challenging but fun! 


-- Fix the caching issue (5 seconds) 
-- Contnue work on the entity maker 
   - just finished the csrf token request , now create interface for Label (data payload with label en) 
[ ] LMAO -- got blocked from editing wikidata by HASLEY | https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User_talk:Hasley 
(IP 73.91.214.134) | expires on 22:23, 9 Jan 2021 - wtf... 
TODO - fix the json post and create wiki entity | how to test editing wikidata without getting blocked! LMAO , need to get in contact with an admin 


Future: 

[x] create a hyperloop main setLog function in tsw and then call this in the medkit.ts file, to 
wire the http request logging directly into the smgr.get("addConsoleText")  -- that way we get automatic 
logging of all the http requests (sparql, json, mesh,etc)... . 


[x] Request the preliminary dat afrom hlm wikidata queries 

[ ] Fix the MeSH Entity Selector Filter (in the tsw/apis/mesh )  

[ ] Can I create a JS Console element which evaluates everything inside of an iframe with limited permissions? 
Once the user inputs a query it is posted to the iframe, there it is evaled and some data structure is returned, 
a number, string, array, or dictrionary, and this is passed back using postMessage. This result is then 
inspected using the React inspector object  

- the security vulnerability would lie in correctly setting iframe evaluation permissions, the postMessage interface, and the way that the inspector object renders its input. 

[ ]  Improve the console logging window to allow for output of objects and inspection 


[ ] Can somehow incorporate crypto 



DREAMCATCHER 
TO FIX:  

[ ] Prompt or PWA install 
[ ] Choose voice 

[x] Volume of the Sound library 
[x] encryption key during the voice tutorial 
  - had a weird error where is said Error saving but i think it worked 
[x] shutting off VOICE recognition on mobile 
   - maybe even hiding the buttons 
[x] CHROME ONLY    


TOCHECK 
: when editing then saving a dream - is the data and time preserved? 


TODO : 
ake sure to update the GET ALL TAGS function
