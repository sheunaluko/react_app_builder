[ ] Can I create a JS Console element which evaluates everything inside of an iframe with limited permissions? 
Once the user inputs a query it is posted to the iframe, there it is evaled and some data structure is returned, 
a number, string, array, or dictrionary, and this is passed back using postMessage. This result is then 
inspected using the React inspector object  

- the security vulnerability would lie in correctly setting iframe evaluation permissions, the postMessage interface, and the way that the inspector object renders its input. 



[ ] Can somehow incorporate crypto 



DREAMCATCHER 
TO FIX:  

[ ] Prompt or PWA install 
[ ] Choose voice 

[x] Volume of the Sound library 
[x] encryption key during the voice tutorial 
  - had a weird error where is said Error saving but i think it worked 
[x] shutting off VOICE recognition on mobile 
   - maybe even hiding the buttons 
[x] CHROME ONLY    


TOCHECK 
: when editing then saving a dream - is the data and time preserved? 


TODO : 
ake sure to update the GET ALL TAGS function
